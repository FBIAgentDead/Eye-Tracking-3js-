# Eye-Tracking-3js-
A three.js project for a hand tracking game

Browse the other two branches for two different games.

-The Arkanoid is the final version which we created in about 3 hours because the original idea didn't work out and we needed to finish something.

-Shooting Astroids is the first hand tracking idea we came up with. The idea was to be able to point your hands at astroids which come flying towards you, and press a button or make a certain finger motion in order to shoot a laser and destroy the astroid.
We couldn't finish this because we ran into too many bugs and had to have a finished project, that's why we ended up creating a different game (We spent a lot of time on this project and were dissapointed we couldn't finish it in time).
